There comes a point when the curated scroll of a social media feed no longer feels like connection, but like an obligation. The decision to quit social media is rarely a grand announcement. It is a quiet departure. For me, the thought of disconnecting is a recurring one, a tempting but seemingly impossible fantasy.

There are a thousand excuses for hesitation. Perhaps the most compelling is when digital platforms become so integrated into a culture that they are no longer "felt" like an optional. Consider the social fabric of a place like Vietnam, where Facebook and Instagram are not just apps, but the primary threads of connection. Daily life is navigated through Messenger; contact is made not through phone numbers or emails, but through direct messages and stories.

To voluntarily remove oneself from this system is to risk breaking a social contract. It brings a sense of guilt, a feeling of deliberately silencing oneself to friends. There is the anxiety of perception: that such a move will be seen not as an act of self-preservation, but of self-importance. There is the fear of being left behind, of missing the quiet updates and major milestones that are now exclusively broadcast online.

Beneath these social anxieties, however, it's a fear of true solitude. It is the fear of loneliness, of no longer having a companion at one's fingertips, of being outside the comforting circle of the network. Social media, for all its faults, offers a powerful antidote to this fear: an ever-present, if superficial, sense of connection.

The digital space, intended for connection, becomes a stage for performance. The self becomes a curated brand, and life a series of updates to be consumed. The anxiety of missing out is eventually eclipsed by the sheer exhaustion of keeping up. The feeling of isolation isn't something that awaits on the other side of logging off; it is already present in the endless, silent scroll.

Quitting social media, then, is not an act of disappearance. It is an argument for a different mode of existence. The path away from the network is quiet, and (perhaps) lonely at first. But it leads toward a different kind of clarity - one that isn't curated or performed, but simply lived.
