Synapse: The spark. The idea. The human element.

Syntax: The structure. The language. The code.

I find that we live our lives between these two concepts: taking the raw sparks of our ideas and feelings (synapse) and constantly trying to shape them into a life with meaning (syntax).

This blog is my own journey through that process, documented.
